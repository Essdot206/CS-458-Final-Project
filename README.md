# CS-458-Final-Project
This is my project for CS 458 UNR 


First and formost:
The amazon-meta.json file would need to be configured to your specifications to locate the file for this project.

some pip installs:
  ```python
  pip install pandas
  pip install numpy
  pip install scikit-learn
  pip install tensorflow
  pip install keras
  pip install scipy
  pip install matplotlib
  pip install seaborn
  pip install nltk
  pip install spacy
  pip install json5
  pip install sqlalchemy
  pip install pymysql
  ``` 

to run the applications:

Comparison modules (Excel spreadsheets will be attached):
  ```python
python3 bookssimilar.py
python3 dvdsimilar.py
python3 musicsimilar.py
python3 videossimilar.py
  ``` 
Find an item through terminal module:
  ```python
python3 find_me.py
  ``` 
Prediction modules:
  ```python
python3 predict_me_dvd.py
python3 predict_me_books.py
python3 predict_me_music.py
python3 predict_me_videos.py
  ``` 
User Interface Module:
  ```python
python3 run_it.py
  ``` 
Graph Module:
  ```python

Also, I have included a Jupyter Notebook PDF showing some of the modules being ran. Note that most of the modules in this particular project are just running the excel spreadsheets.
